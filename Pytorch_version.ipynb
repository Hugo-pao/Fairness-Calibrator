    "In its famous 2016 article about Machine Bias, Pro Publica analysed the software used by the US court of justice to score the likelihood of recidivism for a convincted. They showed that the model used was heavily biased against black people, and was most of the time failing to predict recidivism among the white convincted. Indeed blacks were considered almost twice as likely as whites to be labeled a higher risk but did not actually re-offend more.\n",

    "In 2015, Amazon realized that its recruiting algorithm was far from gender neutral, mostly because it had been trained on 10 years of hiring data dominated by man. The algorithm was penalising women profile because it considered the male attribute to be a good predictor for hiring. They tried different solutions to remove this gender bias but eventually dropped the project.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the perfect example to show that ML solutions completely reflect the society biases as they are learning from \"human\" data and that fairness in ML isn't just about removing the sensible attribute from the data (as hidden bias can exist). This asks the question of how transparent and how explainable these solutions should be, especially in domains such as Justice, employment or Credit. As algorithms are becoming more and more complex, it becomes harder to understand the pattern used by a model to make a decision (i.e why did it hire this specific person or predict a high recidivism score) and as the previous examples showed, discrimination can lead to a lower performance in real world applications. \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as laws across the world evolve to catch up with these models, businesses are even more incentivised to use fair algorithms. Indeed, the time and profit  gained from using a recruiting or credit scoring algorithm is significant but such model must first comply with the local laws to be usable. \n",
    "Moreover, it is often profitable for a company to use fair algorithms as it can help them target new customers. For instance, a Bank with an historic majority of middle aged and senior customers might want to target young adults for risk diversification. In order to do that, it will need its credit scoring algorithm to accept younger people as the model would have only learned to recognize as profitable customers the middle aged/ senior.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Dreamquark is adding an innovative method to its explainable auto ML software : Brain, that can be plugged in after any machine learning models and any tasks (Classification and Regression) to make it fairer based on sensible groups and definitions chosen by the user. Our Fairness Calibrator can provide metrics, visualizations and tackles the problem of hidden bias for tabular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"fairness problem\" is highly domain-specific and thus, requires its own specific definition of fairness. For instance, in a credit scoring situation, we would want to consider the equality in outcome (i.e target should be the same) between female and male, whereas in a fraud detection setting we'd rather look at the false positive and true positive rates and make sure they are not too different between sensible groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The problem of hidden bias**\n",
    "One of the major issue in fair AI is the hidden bias. Also known as implicit bias, it refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. In Machine Learning, it concerns the variables that can be used as predictor for a protected attributes. For instance, in a resume, 'AS Roma fan' in the interest section might be a predictor for the gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "As its name indicates, hidden bias is really hard to find in a dataset, making the problem of removing it even harder. In order to tackle this issue, we remove the sensible attribute column before the training. This action will force the model to learn bias from the hidden part (i.e from the other variables). After the training we 'tell' our calibrators the values of the sensible attribute column to optimize the fairness on these groups. Therefore, our post processing optimization only works to remove the hidden biases since the explicit ones are removed directly before the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How to integrate fairness into business oriented auto ML tool ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto ML constraints\n",
    "Because DreamQuark's software, Brain, is a business oritented auto ML platform, we had to solve several domain specific issues. First, our solution must be model/use case agnostic to fit the auto ML framework. Indeed, in auto ML, it is crucial to implement a general framework that can be used in most scenarios. This is also one of the greatest strenght of our solution since it allows any user to easily use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we had a constraint in terms of computation time. The method shouldn't increase the duration of an usual auto ML task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, since DreamQuark is focused on ethical and explainable AI, the explainability of the model must be preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it was important to make the solution as understandable as possible for the end business user, meaning interpretable visualisations and explainable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The research in fairness Machine learning has defined three ways of mitigating bias : post processing methods, in training methods and post processing methods. The main difference between these approaches is the time at which the bias is removed. \n",
    "* Pre processing : (before training) a new representation of the dataset is learned in an hyperplane where the bias is not present. This can be seen as an embeddings whose aim is to forget bias. This method loses the explainability of the model but is model agnostic. (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04422.pdf). \n",
    "* In training : during the training of the model, a new part accounting for the fairness is added to the loss function. Other model specific method can also be derived (see  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05041.pdf ). This approach is really efficient however it requires to have a complete access to the model parameters (not possible for the xgboost and sklearn packages for instance)\n",
    "* Post processing : once the model has been trained, the output is transformed to forget the bias learned during training. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02413.pdf ). This approach is model agnostic.\n",
    "\n",
    "At DreamQuark, we choosed to focus on the post processing appraoch since it preserves the explainability and is model agnostic, which fits perfectly our auto ML needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most complete package in fairness machine learning is aif360 from IBM. The package contains a whole set of methods in the three categories presented above. The performance in terms of fairness and accuracy of the models are among the bests. However the post processing method only accepts the binary classification setting and the number of sensible groups is limited to 2. Furthermore, the computation time can be optimized and no tradeoff between performance and fairness is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "In this article, we propose a post processing method to introduce fairness in Binary Classification, Multiclass Classification and Regression tasks. The Fairness Calibrator can be plugged in after any model as long as it has a predict_proba method for classification. Furthermore, our solution can accept up to 10 sensible groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Binary classification cases the calibrator object gets fitted by learning a set of thresholds, one for each group, that will be used for the final prediction. By allowing one threshold per group, the model is able to differentiate the prediction between each sensitive groups and thus improving the fairness metric.\n",

    "In the multiclassification and regression settings, the calibrator object gets fitted by learning a set of weights and biases that are going to linearly transform the scores outputed by the model. In the classification settings, each couple (group, class) will be assigned a weight and bias whereas in the regression we will only consider one couple (weight, bias) per sensible group.\n",

    "The Adult Dataset contains data on 50 000 individuals. The goal is to predict wether their annual income is above 50k or not. We are especially interested in the impact of the SEX and RACE features. Indeed, we will consider a model biased if we observe a difference in outcome between the sensible groups created by these features.\n",

    "COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendant’s likelihood of reoffending (recidivism). It has been shown that the algorithm is biased in favor of white defendants, and against black inmates, based on a 2 year follow up study (i.e who actually committed crimes or violent crimes after 2 years).\n",

    "It is important to take into account both Disparate Impact and Statistical parity. Indeed, the first one is the relative difference while the other is the absolute one. \n",
    "We can see that IBM is almost always better in terms of balanced accuracy, however DreamQuark can reach really high level of fairness while maintaining a good amount of performance. Furthermore, since DreamQuark's approach is similar to a deep learning optimization, the user can choose exactly the tradeoff between fairness and performance. \n",

We have attained really good performance compared to the state of the art with a method that doesn't require to have access to the model function. This makes our approach easily usable but also easily tunable thanks to its many hyperparameters and early stop options. \n",
